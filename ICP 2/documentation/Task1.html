<p>A <span style ="color: blue"> <i>Peekapoo</i> </span> is hybrid dog breed â€” a cross between the <span style ="color: blue"><b>Pekingese</b> </span>and  <span style ="color: blue"><b>Poodle breeds.</b> </span>  The mix makes for a wonderful companion dog who will spend their days perched on your lap or sitting by your side. Although these dogs got their start as a designer breed, you may still find them in the care of shelters and rescue groups.</p>
